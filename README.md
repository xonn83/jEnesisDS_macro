jEnesisDS emulator hacked to use only bottom screen (for GBMacro users)

After some days of work (and a bit of luck), I have "hacked" the jEnesisDS emulator and I have included a screen swap just after rom selection.
This is great news for GBMacro users, because it open the possibility to play with Genesis games, at a great FPS and with SOUND!
